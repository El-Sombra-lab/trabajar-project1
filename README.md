# trabajar-project1
Repo which contains codes for a website I designed for a fuel supply company, they're new in the energy industry so they wanted a website which represents their vision and manifesto.
More features and functionalities are still to be added to the site, I used HTML, bootstrap, javascript, and css.
The folder contains all the files along with site images.
